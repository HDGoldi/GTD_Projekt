Once those outliers are removed we can see that for the killed (nkill) and wounded (nwound) 75% of the values fall between 0 and 2. 
Which makes the Interquartile range (IQR) of those variables 2.  While for the killed and wounded terrorists (nkillter and nwoundte) we see that with the ouliers removed, 100% of the values are 0. 
Because of that we will be focusing on the number of casualties (sum of the killed and wounded without terrorists) in the further examinations of this dataset.
