One of the major challenges with the univariate analysis of the dataset was the low quantity of interval variables. 
Out of the 32 variables in the cleansed dataset only 4 were interval and contained enough data to be used for a closer look at measures of location and dispersion.
Beyond that the univariate analysis mainly focuses on the frequency distributions of the variables.

The 4 major interval variables are the number of killed and wounded people and terrorist for each incident. 
When we look at the boxplots for these values, we see that the range of the values is quite high with some extrem outliers at the top, while the median is 0.
